Project 7) Operation World Saver (2023) (3) 🌎🌍🌏☀️❄️

1) Sun's Controller ☀️
I've this idea back in 2023 when the I felt a strange heat in Summer season;
(believe me or not it was like the spring ended sooner than usual and the trees that was in my street for over 100 years became thirsty, enough that we discovered that they have cells!) 
This controller has a shape of a Diomand Cristal, it's designed to be thrown into the Sun's Maine core and control the sun's inside system from within;
Unfortunately they're several problems:
1_ in order to send this controller inside the Sun main core, we need something like a magnete to protect it from he melting or malfunctioning, 
I thought we may be able to create a magnete that can harness the organic materials of the sun's layer as an Armor, to protect itself from the melting, 
2_ I don't know how to connect it with the plant's core! 
3_ how to create a controller that can be controlled from a planet to another? 

2) Earth's Artifical Atmosphere layer 🌍
As you all may know our planet's atmosphere layer has become powerless because of the Air pollution and farming gases, so in order to stop or slow this process, 
I Designed a device that we can use it inside the Earth's core, to create an Artifical Atmosphere layer, but there consequences and I has the same unsolved problems the the sun's Controller has
consequences: we might die out of thick atmosphere, even if we manage to create such idea, we might get poison from the pollution or the thick air pressure! 

3) super sized Freaze Canon ❄️
In my opinion this one is easier compared to the other ideas of this operation, 
I thought about the heat for a long time and I believe this might help to reduce it a bit longer, 
This cannon is designed to create large thick ices similar to the natural ices in North and South of the Earth, by aim this Canon to them we may be able to increase the size of the natural ice of our planet! 
There may be some dangers but I'm sure it's worth the risk
