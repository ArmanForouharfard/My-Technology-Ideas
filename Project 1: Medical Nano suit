Project 1) Medical Nano suit üè•‚öïÔ∏è (2017)
I Designed a surgery from inside the human's body with no physical connection from outside, it use 2 Ai
One Baymax (the healthcare AI) and the cammander AI (which do the surgery), nanotechnology and biotechnology;
Baymax is remote head surgeon on this project which track every moves of the commander Ai during the surgery, it's like a retired surgeon doctor who can't do the surgery for physical reasons but he has the ability to watch the surgery to insure that the patient's vitals are normal, the commander Ai is the same head surgeon that do the surgery on the room along with other nurses and doctors;
The reason that I used both nanotechnology and biotechnology is that they are their equals,

Nanotechnology has the ability to make Artificial materials like metals, woods, plastics and other things alike,

But Biotechnology is used for organic materials, and as I writing this scientists are using 3d bio printing to create organic greens, foods, 
In this project I combined both tech to create artifical but organic body part, or heal the damage part of the subject's body ;
This suit also have to a UV glass that Baymax can communicate with the subject and show what is he doing on the subject's body during the process, all of the reports will be send and save in the patient's doctor's tablet or computer and hospital's servers;
This suit have other capabilities even when the surgery is complete, the patient can use the suit's other parts to control the suit and to train them, 
The suit's hands have access to a opsat computer, and they can see the results of their healing process and the medical records, they can also talk to Baymax to insure the don't show any side effects after the surgery, (note: you communicate with Ai 24/7 if it's necessary for you );
the suit's leg are mostly for training excises, we've seen too many people had or having trouble to walk or move their body like they use to, this medical suit can help to move their bodies even they're unable to move (Baymax Ai is also your trainer and you can ask him to help) 

Emergency protocols
To insure that the suit work normally, all hospitals, the ambulances and fire stations have access to this suit, and incase of any mufunctioning, the patient and the doctor can remove the suit even during the surgery by moving the emergency panel on the left or right side of suit's wrist, by using this protocol the hospital and hospitals will be reserved a code color to to be ready for emergency services for the patient. 
And the nano surgeons will stop the surgery and use the self destruction sequence to deactivate themselves with causing any harm to the patients at all cost.
