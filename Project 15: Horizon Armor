Project 15) Horizon Armor ðŸŒŽðŸ¤– (2023)
You might heard the name Horizon from the 
"Horizon zero down & forbidden west" video games;
And believe me or not this is a full tactical Armor that I've made out the our main character "Aloy", along with the animal robots that we see in the game,
This Armor is similar to the Ironman's Armor and I also has sun's solar panel wings
