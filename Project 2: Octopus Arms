Project 2) Octopus Arms 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻(2018)
I found the idea of doc octopus interest, even as a child I thought the man made an extraordinary idea to create,
I marvel spider-man ps4 I found out these arms are actually work with neuro web technology but the malfunctions were too high,
making the risk of brain cell damage to highly possible, imagine a car for example, 
every vehicle requires a fuel to move but it dry eventually and you need to add more fuel again and again; 
now on this idea brain can work as a fuel as well I may be look normal at first considering it need to work with the brain in order to do different things, 
but if the hardwares not work properly there is a chance that the machine use you as main source of its power and what's worst of it is that the subject's brain cell functioning goes lower than normal making the brain dry,

In this project I modified the design to have an arc reactor in the back to use as a main power source, 
to connect machine with brain I used nouro interface technology in order to read the commands only, 
the hard part of the this project is that the hardware that connects the human and machine should be programmed to stop the machine, 
making it impossible to hurt the human subject,

(The original designs problem) 🚩
I checked the design multiple times in 2018 during the time that the game announced and I noticed something I couldn't believe, 
On the design Peter (spider-man) and Dr. Otto Octavius was working neuro webs that can connect the subject's mind to the arms, 
but I checked the design and there was no power source at all! Maybe they were added in the arms?, 
but I saw the brain damage that caused to Dr. Ocravious and it was horrifying, 
his brain cells activity reduced and he lost some his speech and processing activities, it's like a simple vehicle, 
the more you use it the feul you require, but the brain's feul is the cells!, the more Dr. Octavious used the machine the more cells used as fuel, 
even if there is a way to replace/increase the brain cells, it would take years even decades to recover, 
that's why I'm working on this project because I believe there has to be another way to use them without any side effects like this)
