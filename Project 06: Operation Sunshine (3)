Project 6) Operation Sunshine (3) 🌏🧑‍🚀☀️(2020)
This is one of my favorite project, it's a full covered sun solar panel Armor for traveling the entire solar system's plants with a single trip,
I used Iron man's Armor mark 39,
by using Nanotechnology, sun solar panels, Arc reactor, and solar charging technologies;
this Armor has 2 Arc reactor:
1) is the full Arc reactor which is used for emergency and necessary power source, 
2) the empty Arc reactor to harness the Sun energy from the solar panels;
This Armor has multiple solar chargers, that user can place them with dishes on each planet as an emergency power back ups
The purpose of the this project is to travel to the forest planet of our solar system and return to Earth 🌎🌍🌏 at a single trip.
