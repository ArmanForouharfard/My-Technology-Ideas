# 💡 My 129 Technology Ideas (In Progress)

This repository is a collection of **129 original technology project ideas** I have developed over time, precisely since i was in highschool back in 2016-2017.
They reflect my curiosity and passion for **Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and Modern Day Technologies**.

I decided to share them here instead of keeping them in the shadows — so others (students, developers, innovators) can explore, learn, and even build on them.
