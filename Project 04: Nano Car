Project 4) Nano Car 🏎️ (2019)
This idea a bit far fat etched considering the fact that I may cause trouble in vehicle market but I give it a try
To put it simply you have any car inside a single car shell, 
Imagine that you have car from any type of vehicle company 
I'll go with Lamborghini my favorite, by using Nanotechnology and a database of their 3d prints you can all of its versions in one shell, 
from the first version of the until the latest version that is available in the market, with the costomazation option that's available in your phone, 
you can either have access to its features on your phone or your smart watch
