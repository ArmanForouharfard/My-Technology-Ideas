Project 23) The Omnitrix watchâŒš (update 2)
(2024)
You might think that I'm crazy with this childish ideas, but trust me, you'll like it! 

This idea has been found during the time I was working on Animal Expansion Project, 
it's Design to read DNA codes and combine them with human's DNA, and no we're not talking about the Transforming the the human's DNA permanently, but as a temporary transformation without injecting the intruder DNA to our system;
This watch allow the user to use a DNA database of different Animals for a short time,
(The real question is how to write those DNA codes into computer codes so that the watch can use them?)
By activating the watch the human body start to transform into a unique combination of between human and the chosen Animal DNA from the database.

I've talked to Deepseek AI about this project and he confirmed that it is possible to create such technology but it has some issues that it requires to work on the first thing is the server, 
in order to use the animal's genetic codes we need to turn them into computer codes first which is possible to do so but the process and slow react will a huge issue in this project that's why I added a cloud server instead of a physical server, 
I order to speed up the process and have better network internet connection between the watch and the cloud server,
I also designed a diagram for the process and told Deepseek AI to analyze it, and it was a huge success,
Now the main issue is the DNA side effects that may cause throughout the transformation of the user,
As we know nothing will inject to our genes, but it maybe possible during this process the body and metal behavior affected during the time that we transform ourselves into a man_animal form

Here is the diagram:
