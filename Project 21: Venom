Project 21) Venom (black suit) 🕷️🕸️🏴
(2024)
The is project is full nanotech project with a limited self learning Ai, that mimic the character venom, it can shape to any type of form and it's flexible like a liquid metal, 
it can turn into a suit similar to black suit spider-man (or symbiote suit in the other name) it also has access to neuro interface technology to connect the user's mind with the nanobots, 
they have commanders that allow the neuro interface technology to connect to them (there is no need connect all the nanobots directly to interface, we just need nanobots links)
