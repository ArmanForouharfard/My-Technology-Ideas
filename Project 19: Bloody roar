Project 19) Bloody roar (connected with Animal Expansion Project) ðŸ’€ðŸ‘¹
(2024)
In my mind palace I was trying to work on the Animal Expansion Project but I saw different possibilities that can cause danger,
I was trying to use human DNA to increase some of the Endangered Animals but I believe that I gone too far using it, because the Animals I was thinking of turned into half human and half their spechies!
But they were also able to turn them into a hole human and their spechies! Which it is a relief!
I used Leperd, American Eagle, Eguana, and Grey wolf as a test subject and all of them turned unsuccessful (at list in Animal Expansion Project)
