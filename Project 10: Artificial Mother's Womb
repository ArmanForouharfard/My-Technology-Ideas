Project 10) Artificial Mother's Womb (for adults) (2019) ðŸšº
I found this idea during watching a conjoined twins surgery, turns out that the conjoined twins body work a one human body with two mind, making it risky as it sounds to do a simple separation surgery that both host survive, the reason behind incomplete human body in the mother's womb process is still unknown and they're much we don't know about it, but we can build a adult mother womb in order to revive the human's incomplete bodie's complete, which means not only we can use it for conjoined twins but a simple human body with lost part of its own too, the challenge of this project is to make sure the human body reacts exactly is required in order not to change our human physicall form (to turn us into mutants)

During the process the womb use the artificial materials, the same materials that use for the original mother womb, the second challenge is to make them artificial, the needs specialist guidance and team working of course.
