Project 11) Healer eyes ðŸ‘€ (2018)
This is sport style glasses that allow the users to heal their eyes, regardless of the rate of the damage, 
these glasses use nano surgeons I used on Exo skeleton medical nano suit, for this project the only difference is these nano surgeons are programmed to do surgeries on eyes, 
they can reduce the sight rate number, cure their blood pressure problems, even bring back their eyes using bio printing!
