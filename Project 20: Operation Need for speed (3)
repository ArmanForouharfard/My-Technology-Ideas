Speed Gloves: Enhanced Racing and Combat Gear
Inspiration:
The design for these gloves is inspired by the high-octane world of Need for Speed Rivals, where the line between racers and police blurs in a battle of speed and strategy. These gloves are designed to give the wearer access to advanced vehicle components, 
blending racing and combat functionalities into a sleek, wearable form.

The gloves integrate the following components, borrowed from both racer and police car arsenals:

EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse): Temporarily disables electronic systems in nearby vehicles, giving the wearer a tactical advantage.

EMC (Electromagnetic Clutch): Enhances grip and control, allowing for precise handling in high-speed scenarios.

Spikes: Deployable spikes for defensive or offensive maneuvers, such as puncturing tires or deterring pursuers.

Shockwave Device: Emits a powerful shockwave to disrupt or disable nearby vehicles.

Turbo Boost: Originally intended to provide a burst of speed, but in this iteration, it‚Äôs reimagined for use in an armor system rather than the gloves themselves.

Electric Trap: Lays down an electrified field to immobilize or damage pursuing vehicles.

Electrical Shield: Creates a protective barrier to deflect incoming attacks or EMPs.

Design Challenges and Solutions:
One of the main issues with the turbo boost component is that it doesn‚Äôt translate well to gloves‚Äîafter all, gloves can‚Äôt propel the wearer forward at high speeds. To address this, I decided to reimagine the turbo as part of a larger armor system. This armor would complement the gloves, 
providing enhanced mobility, protection, and speed boosts while the gloves focus on tactical and offensive capabilities.
1) Racer Armor:
This Armor is an Ironman Armor in red and orange and it only has access to the Racers car's component (some of them are as same as the police Armor) 
This Armor may require for some physical improvements in order to not take any lethal damage, but it's fast and if the user is clever enough to use it and modify it in time, it can be a great tool for the mission they seek. 
2) Police Armor:
This Armor is and an Ironman Armor in black and white color that also has police lights added to the chest, it also has the access to the police components only and unlike the Racer Armor, it requires few physical improvements and it's ready to be deployed whenever it needed.
