Project 18) Devil & Angel Armor 😈😇🪶🕊️🔥 (3)
(2024)
These projects is the first childern of Sunshine Armor (the concept of this idea have taken from the TEKKEN video game/(Devil jin & kazuya)) , same as Sunshine this Armor have access to sub solar panel technology and boosters to Increase the speed during flight, but there 2 thing added to this project that no one ever thought of
1) bird type solar wings,
2) third eye (which has laser technology on it and it installed on the Armor's helmet)

Why these are unique?
Well it because noe have came close to this Armor,
Wings are invented for a long time but the only و ا who have ever came close (birds wings anatomy) is none other than Leonardo da'winchi himself, his flying machine is the only unique tech in human history that came close to the bird wings
Another that makes these wings interesting is that they're connect to the helmet by using neuro interface technology, same as Octupus Arms thus armor can connect with user and the wings artificially,
But unlike his mother Sunshine
Devil Armor can't travel to the far distance in space because it meant to be fast the solar charger in Sunshine can't have any space to carry,

But!
These Armor has another supervise, it's lava proof !
With the right Alloy this Armor can literally swimm in Magma,
the only problem is the user's skin problem,
The Armor may servive the lava but the human skin will melt, even if the user servived, there is a huge chance that the user get skin cancer or even liquafaction, which extremely painful, and requires heavy medical attention!

3) Ghost drones
But in case of emergency the Armor has Drones, that able to lift or using laser to fix or destroy things, all also powered by purple solar panels
