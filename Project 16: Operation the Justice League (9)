Project 16) Operation the Justice League (9) ‚öñÔ∏è
1) Iron Knight ü¶á (2018) 
This is my first Armor of this list, and I love it, in this project I used nanobots to create bats that active the armor when I start using the bat frequency signal, 
they create the armor while i surround by them while I activate the the signal, and then the start mirging with each other, then armor is ready to use and play, 
It has no long cape but a mini cape similar to the cape of batman beyond (you can find the modern version in arkham knight video game), but that's not the only thing I customized 
I replace the helmet with Arkham knight tactical adviser mask and 

2) Man of Steel ü¶∏üèª (2024) 
This project is the third child of Sunshine Armor ‚òÄÔ∏è it has access to sun solar panels and 2 Arc reactor (like it's mother, one is full with vibranium and one is empty to save the sun's energy) 
But this Armor has laser sight on his helmet's eyes (like his first brother the devil Armor) and it has boosters back on his legs, that allow him to fly faster
It also has a sonic scream device with high frequency that allows him to distract the enemie's Consciousness for a moment, it can be lethal but it also can be controllable, 
And frozen breath using liquid nitrogen allowing the user to shot fires down, or freeze an object.¬† 

3) Amazonian Hawk Armor (2019, 2024) 
This is the fourth child of the Sunshine Armor project this Armor's design has been taken from the movie wonder woman 1984, same as his brothers, this Armor has fully cover with gold sun's solar panels, that NASA use it for its satellites, 
this concept also has bracelets that works precisely like the original wonder woman's bracelets, I found this idea during the time I was working on new bracers for my hidden blade designs (from AcC brotherhood), 
But one thing that is incomplete in this project is the laso which we know it as laso of truth, I tried to find a way to use a fabric that Its impregnated with a truth serum but I do think anything like this is real, 
So instead of that I've used electrical wires that can send electrical shocks to all part of the rope Instead, and it's safe for the user to use it, it's also of submission now ‚ö°

4) Savitar Speedster ‚ö°üèÉ(2024) 
Project speedster is a bit different then the others,
I used a an Arc Reactor to using quarts Crystal that has trapped lightning bolt! With this new prototype reactor, we may be able to harness the lightning and use it without any mufunctioning or issues,
But in this project I installed it on a Armor that allow the user to run fast! (this idea has been taken from the flash series)
This Armor can do multiple things like:
1) Running fast,
2) Making turnado, 
3) Boost a lightning, 
4) Phase through walls,
5) make speed mirage,
Etc

5) God lantern Ring üèÆüíç(2024) 
This one is one of my favorite projects that I made in 2024, this ring has access to solid halografic technology, allowing the user to have solid halograms, you can touch them and feel them,
I used a Reduced size of an Arc Reactor, I shrinked it using Pym particles, and installed on top of the ring, and neuro interface technology to connect with the user's mind,
And installed the solid halo graphic device on top of the reactor and connect with it;
The user has access to different abilities like:
1) creating different objects,
2) repairing damages in different fields
3) replacing materials by using their design and other details
(I think I'd be better if I also use nanotechnology especially for ability num 3)

6) Aquaman's sea translator ü¶ªüê†ü¶ä (2024) 
I took this concept from the Aquaman's movie, 
This is a translator designed for the sea species of our planet, by using sonic technology and the right frequency, we can use water to talk and understand their language. 
There is a second version of this translator for the surface Animals that I added in another page as (Surface Animal Translator) 

7) Canery Scream üê¶üò± (2019) 
This project is a device that connected to a chocker and you can use it on your neck, 
It improve your voice and it activate when you start to scream, 
It activates when you start to make high frequency sounds like screams, however it's controllable during your conversations, (we don't want to make someone like black bolt in marvel!). 

8) Phantom Bow üèπ üíò (2019) 
This is a Phantom Bow that installed on a bracer (similar to Ac Unity phantom blade) though this phantom should has 2 different sizes the first one is the exact phantom blade when you need it for close shooting, 
and the larger bow that expanded version of the phantom blade, it also have a arrow case with different arrows that allow the user to choose them for different situations. 

9) Goddess of Zoanthrope ü¶Å (2023)
This Necklace is an adopter powered by bio-nano technology, a self-contained AI/mini-computer, and DNA code cloud server, similar to Project Omnitrix's design, 
it uses all Planet Earth's Animal specie's genetic codes and transform the user's DNA codes temporary to inherit the chosen Animal's ability to their own, 
the necklace has physical connection to the user's body and thanks to bio-nano technology that created the necklace and supervise the transformation process, it would be much easier to gain the Animals ability, 
the problem is the necklace has to stay connected to internet, so Deepseek suggested to add a back up database with a limited number of DNA codes stored in the mini computer, 
there still some other options to work on but that's a start;
