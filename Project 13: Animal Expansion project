Project 13) Animal Expansion project 🦁🦊🐅 (2022)
This is a vast project that aim to the endangered animals of our planet Earth,
I believe we can increase the number of their population by using the human hormones, and let them give birth a high number of their new generation, 
but under control and every precautions, so the mother won't have any medical issues that cause suffering or death!,
Our purpose is to increase and even restore the speacies that are going to be erased or already erased from our planet
