Project 22) Project Anti Venom (white suit) 🕷️🕸️🏥🏳️
(2024)
This project's nanobots are the opposite of Venom Project, unlike the first prototype these nanobots are white instead of black and their purpose is to heal diseases like cancers, 
syndromes and rare sickness or viruses, however it also has the same abilities that the black symbiote has.
