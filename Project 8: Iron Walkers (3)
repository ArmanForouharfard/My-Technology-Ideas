Project 8) Iron walkers ðŸš¶(3)
(2022) 
This Armor is a combination between Ironman Armor and the D-walkers (from Metal gear Video games)
This Armor appearance is similar to war machine Armor, it has 1 large gun installed on right shoulder and 2 mini pistols on both shoulder (the weapons are customizable)
It also have 1 cold weapon (it can be machete or a CQC knife)
And it also have D-walkers rollers installed on the Armor's foots that allows the user to drive in short or long distances without flying
But the flying option is still intact like all of the other projects, 
We can also use different military camouflages on it, 
And last time I checked it personally the (mgs 5 phantom pain Video game) had multiple camouflages, 
With the number of the weapons and camos I believe their number, we can create 250 marks of the Iron walker Armor! 
There also 2 Armors that I designed from the that list
1)Sahelanthropus Armor (using metallic arkeia)
2) Diomand snake Armor
(attention these 2 Armor cannot be constomized)
