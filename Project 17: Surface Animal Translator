Project 17) Surface Animal Translator 🐺🏞️
(2024)
This project is a combination of the Cenery scream and Aquaman's underwater translator, but this project is meant to translate the surface Animal's language and frequencies,
It has a earpad and a chocker device that connects to the animals, turning their frequencies into human language
