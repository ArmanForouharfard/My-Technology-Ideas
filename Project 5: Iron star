Project 5) Iron star ðŸŒŸ (2019)
This Armor is full tactical bescar Armor (from Star wars series) that I made during the time I was watch mandalorian series, 
we haven't be able to make a metal like that but the concept is a heavily recognizable and workable in different situations,
I used Ironman's Armor design and captain America's shield as a concept art, but what this Armor special is the shield and the Armor's gloves, 
I've managed to design a force gloves that is work just like a magnet, we just have to find an element that use in different elements like wood, and other materials;
These gloves can use neuro interface technology to connect to the user's brain, the gloves are able to push, pull, and different things, with energy, but how to observe the energy around us to do it?
Any way the shield saber has multiple light sabers installed behind it and the user use the separately whatever to use them by using the gloves or during the combat
